# Botball Tournament Code 2023
This is the code for the Rebot, and the Dubot. The Rebot is in charge of handling things below ground, while the Dubot (the roomba) is in charge of handling things above ground. The Dubot will reach high places that the Rebot cannot, and the Rebot, will sort poms on the tournament board
